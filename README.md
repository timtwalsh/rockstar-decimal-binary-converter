A rockstar implementation of a simple Decimal to Binary converter
```
Pain takes Cause and Effect (function pain[cause, effect])
while Cause is as high as Effect (while cause >= effect)
Put Cause minus Effect into Cause (cause = cause - effect)

Give back Cause (return cause)

Listen to Passion (input Passion)
Rock Fear (fear = [])
Power is earthshaking (power = 2)
Hatred is everything (hatred = 0)
while Passion is bigger than Hatred (while passion > hatred)
Put Pain taking Passion & Power into Misery (misery = Pain[Passion, Power])
Rock Fear with Misery (fear.append[misery])
Let Passion be over Power (passion /= power)
turn down Passion (floor[passion])

The Devil is 666 (devil = 666)
Let the Devil be without 666 (devil - 666)
Let the Devil be with Fear (devil + fear)
Knock the Devil down (devil--)

while the Devil is as high as Hatred (while devil >= hatred)
shout Fear at the Devil (print[fear[devil]])
Knock the Devil down (devil--)
```
