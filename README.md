Pain takes Cause and Effect (function pain[cause, effect])

Rock God (God = [])
Their Power is earthshaking (Their Power = 2)
The World is everything (The World = 0)
while Your Passion is higher than The World (while passion > The World)
Put Pain taking Your Passion & Their Power into Courage (Courage = Pain[Passion, Their Power])
Rock God with Courage (God.append[Courage])
Let Your Passion be over Their Power (passion /= Their Power)
turn down Your Passion (floor[passion])

The Devil is 666 (devil = 666)
Let the Devil be without 666 (devil - 666)

Knock the Devil down (devil--)

while the Devil is as high as The World (while devil >= The World)
shout God at the Devil (print[God[devil]])
Knock the Devil down (devil--)
